## Opening the project on vscode

During this stage you'll continue working on the same `se_project_library` folder you've already worked on

---

## Brief & Checklist

Some projects will contain detailed briefs, designed to emulate a list of requirements made by a client in a real life scenario.

For the first couple of sprints, Briefs are in depth sources of information, everything you need to finish the project is found here

---

## Brief & Checklist

The checklist works as a way to guarantee we followed the steps correctly. You should always go through the checklist and ensure your code checks all the boxes.

---

⚠️ One of the most common errors on this sprint is having errors on the HTML or css files. Most of this errors can be detected by using prettier to format the code

- If the file doesn't format after clicking Format with prettier that means we have an error
- A red box will show on the lower corner of the VSCode
  We can also use W3C validation websites
- https://validator.w3.org/ -> For HTML validation
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ -> for css validation
