**S0-D1**

Lecture 1

  - There will be an orientation, right? I believe there is a short new student orientation. And then you should give a brief intro to the platform. Maybe it should be added to the slides?
  - Add brief slide about CSS before mentioning it
  - It would be good to incorporate a simple example that you could point to while covering things. Like, when you introduce tags, you could show some actual working examples, not just code blocks. Maybe one of the AI generated tasks would suffice

Lecture 1

- This seems pretty packed. You might move the devtools part to the project lecture on Wednesday. Although quite possibly you'll want to use the devtools when working on examples, so you would need to keep at least a minimal intro

Lecture 1
	
  - Unfortunately, we explicitly disallow the `*` selector everywhere except in sprint 0, because BEM, so maybe you should omit it from the slides here
  - The AI chapter has been expanded with cross-curriculum lessons and moved to be after the project, so let's move this to the lecture on Thursday

Lecture Project
	
  - Maybe add stuff about the devtools if it hasn't been covered. Or just give a refresher about how to use them, with the project as context. You can use our canonical project if you wants


**S0-D4**

- add the brief AI content

Lecture 1

- The practice folder is empty
- It would be very good to have working examples to demonstrate the links, smooth scrolling, pseudoclasses

Lecture 2

- there are some rules for BEM that students are always neglecting, these should be covered in a slide
  - An element can never be placed outside the corresponding block.
  - A modifier can't be used on an HTML element without also including the thing it modifies.
  - A modifier should only store the styles that are actually being _modified_.

Lecture 1

I tried fixing the Ctrl+` inline but failed. I suggest a replacement using a code block
