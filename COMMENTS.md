## Sprint-0

Most of the lectures for sprint-0 felt pretty easy for the students to digest, only exception being the S0D2L2. But not entirely sure what could we trim, my best guess would be to remove the `box-model` part of the lecture, but I do believe that's worth pointing out

During the lectures I tried to apply the concepts while moving along the slides and seemed to work fine for sprint-0, I feel that showing the styles on its most basic form without the distraction of pretty designs/precreated exercises is better for just getting started and the platform already does a lot of nice looking lectures where they practice this concepts

Would love to hear your thoughts on this,

## Sprint-1

For sprint-1 I followed this same methodology for explaining concepts and so far it has resulted in a lot of interaction/good questions and practical examples, but here's my suggestion for next iterations:

- D1: I created a small example that doesn't use BEM or semantic HTML, and since BEM lecture is short I refactored that file with the help of the students. This is to show both how dificult it's to read a file that doens't follows best conventions.

  - [Practice File](./Lectures/Sprint-1/D1/practice/bem-refactor/index.html)
  - I simplified it a lot from the version I used on class seeing that it took a bit longer than I thought

- D2:

- For the positioning class I tried following the same methodology of just showing the Positioning elements in real time and going on from their questions, but in retrospective for this one having a better structured example would have been better. I created a basic one to be used on the future

  - [Practice File](./Lectures/Sprint-1/D2/practice/positioning/index.html)

- The VScode class went relatively smooth. One common issue I saw was students having difficulty with opening folders and creating files. Not sure if this is something that we can work or just a matter of practice. Mainly used the slides to make sure I didn't miss any extension that we needed to install or hotkeys, but spend most of the lecture showing the actual VSCode interface

- D3:
  - The project lecture went great, most understood how to start the project, configure prettier and using the CSS/HTML validations.
    - A good chunk of students already finished the project by the end of D3
  - The paths lecture went great, I created a basic folder structure and went on to move files around and created nested folders to show several examples, most students apparently got the concept right. The couple that did struggle where mainly struggling with the concept of moving back(`../`) on the folders
